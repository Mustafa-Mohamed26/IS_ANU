# AI Search Algorithms 🚀

This repository contains implementations of fundamental **AI search algorithms**, including **uninformed search, heuristic search, and neural networks**. Each algorithm is explained with code examples, visualizations, and real-world applications.

## 🔍 Algorithms Covered

### ✅ Uninformed Search (Blind Search)
1. **Breadth-First Search (BFS)** – Explores all nodes level by level, ensuring the shortest path in an unweighted graph.
2. **Depth-First Search (DFS)** – Explores deep paths first, useful for exhaustive searches and backtracking.
3. **Uniform Cost Search (UCS)** – Expands the lowest-cost path first, ensuring optimal solutions in weighted graphs.

### ✅ Informed Search (Heuristic-Based)
4. **Greedy Best-First Search** – Expands the most promising node using heuristics, but may not guarantee optimality.
5. **A* (A-Star) Search** – Uses **f(n) = g(n) + h(n)** to balance cost and heuristics, ensuring optimal paths.

### ✅ Advanced AI Approaches
6. **Genetic Algorithms (GA)** – Uses evolutionary techniques (selection, mutation, crossover) for optimization.
7. **Neural Networks (NNs)** – Implements deep learning to recognize patterns and make intelligent decisions.

## 🚀 Features
- **Python implementations** for each algorithm.
- **Visualizations** to understand search behavior.
- **Time complexity analysis** for performance comparison.
- **Real-world applications** to demonstrate practical use cases.
